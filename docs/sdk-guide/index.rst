SDK Developers Guide
====================

Congratulations on embarking on the noble quest to create your own BlockChyp SDK.
We thank you and we honor you and we wish you well.

This document will give you some advice and tips about how to think the BlockChyp
way and make your noble efforts successful.

.. note::  This is the obligatory section where we encourage you not to develop your own SDK if there are already good SDK's available for your platform.  As of this writing BlockChyp has developed and supports Java and Javascript SDK's for your enjoyment.  More are on the way.

Simplicity First
----------------

BlockChyp's mission is simplicity.  If you've ever done an integration with a
card present EMV payment system, you've been through hell.  These systems are,
more often than not, overly complex, poorly documented and when you run into
trouble, straight answers from the payment companies are rare.
